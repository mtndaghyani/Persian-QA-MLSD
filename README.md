# Persian Question Answering Model

## Overview
This project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline aimed at building a Question Answering model for the Persian language. The pipeline encompasses four main phases: Requirement Engineering and Specification, Data Gathering, Preprocessing, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Modeling and Comparison of Different Baselines, and finally, Deployment and Monitoring.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Requirement Engineering and Specification
In this phase, the project goals, requirements, and specifications were defined. Key tasks and objectives included:
- Identifying the need for a Persian Question Answering model.
- Defining the scope and objectives of the project.
- Determining the target audience and use cases.
- Setting up success criteria and performance metrics.

### Phase 2: Data Gathering, Preprocessing, and EDA
In this phase, the focus was on obtaining relevant data, preparing it for modeling, and conducting exploratory data analysis. Key tasks and objectives included:
- Sourcing Persian language text data suitable for question answering.
- Preprocessing the data, which may include text cleaning, tokenization, and handling missing values.
- Performing EDA to gain insights into the dataset, such as distribution of data, question-answer pairs, and potential biases.

### Phase 3: Modeling and Comparison of Different Baselines
This phase involved building, training, and evaluating various machine learning models for question answering. Key tasks and objectives included:
- Developing baseline models using common techniques and algorithms.
- Experimenting with advanced models, such as transformer-based architectures, for improved performance.
- Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, F1 score, and others.
- Comparing and selecting the best-performing model(s) based on predefined criteria.

### Phase 4: Deployment and Monitoring
In the final phase, the focus shifted towards deploying the selected model(s) and establishing a monitoring system. Key tasks and objectives included:
- Deploying the question answering model in a suitable production environment.
- Setting up monitoring and alerting systems to track model performance and potential issues.
- Ensuring scalability, reliability, and efficiency of the deployed system.
- Ongoing monitoring and maintenance to address any drift in data or model performance.
